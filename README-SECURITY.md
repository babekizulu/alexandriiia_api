# API Security Implementation

This API has been secured according to industry best practices and OWASP API Security Top 10 recommendations.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting (express-rate-limit)
- General API rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- Auth routes rate limiting: 5 login attempts per hour per IP address
- This prevents brute force attacks, DDoS attempts, and limits impact of credential stuffing

### 2. CORS Protection (cors middleware)
- Whitelist-based approach: only trusted domains are allowed
- Configured with secure headers and options
- Prevents cross-origin resource sharing attacks

### 3. Input Validation (Joi)
- Schema-based validation for all API endpoints
- Strict type checking and validation rules
- Prevents injection attacks and unexpected inputs

### 4. Error Handling
- Custom error handling middleware
- Production mode hides stack traces (set NODE_ENV=production)
- Standardized error responses with appropriate status codes
- Sanitized error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### 5. Additional Security Measures
- Helmet.js: Adds security headers to prevent various attacks
  - XSS Protection
  - Content Security Policy
  - MIME Type Sniffing Prevention
  - Frame Options to prevent clickjacking
- JSON payload size limits to prevent DoS attacks

## OWASP API Security Top 10 Compliance

1. **Broken Object Level Authorization**: Implemented proper authorization checks
2. **Broken User Authentication**: Secure auth routes with rate limiting
3. **Excessive Data Exposure**: Filtered responses to include only necessary data
4. **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**: Implemented tiered rate limiting
5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**: Ensured proper role-based access
6. **Mass Assignment**: Used Joi validation to strictly define allowed fields
7. **Security Misconfiguration**: Used secure configurations with Helmet
8. **Injection**: Validated all inputs with Joi
9. **Improper Assets Management**: Documented and secured all API endpoints
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Implemented appropriate error logging

## Usage

All security measures are automatically applied to the API. Developers should:

1. Create proper validation schemas for all new endpoints
2. Always check authorization before accessing sensitive data
3. Use the error handling middleware for all errors
4. Always run in production mode on production servers

## Configuration

Security configurations can be adjusted in:
- `middleware/rateLimiter.js`
- `middleware/corsConfig.js`
- `middleware/validator.js`
- `middleware/errorHandler.js`
